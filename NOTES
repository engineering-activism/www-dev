We are a group of engineers, scientists, researchers, doers, and makers – people with technical skills and a desire to make an impact. We are involved in issues a diverse as climate change, social justice, privacy, women and minority rights, and getting money out of politics. We are not a single-issue organization; instead, we empower people with specialized skills to take action using those skills.
 
We provide technical training for activists and activist training for technical folks. We do this in a fun and inviting way, making these topics accessible to a wide audience. We help organizers and engineers find each other, develop solid working relationships, and understand how we can help one another. To date, we’ve focused our efforts on the Boston area. If you’d like to help us expand, please reach out!
